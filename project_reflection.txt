PROJECT REFLECTION - Diabetes Risk Prediction
================================================================================

WHAT WORKED WELL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚úì Feature Selection Strategy
  ‚Ä¢ Simplified from 21+ features to 6 clinically relevant ones
  ‚Ä¢ Selected features (BMI, Age, GenHlth, HighBP, HighChol, PhysActivity) 
    balanced predictive power with user-friendly input
  ‚Ä¢ Made the web interface simple and accessible

‚úì Model Comparison Approach
  ‚Ä¢ Compared Logistic Regression (baseline) vs Histogram GBDT (advanced)
  ‚Ä¢ Used validation set for objective model selection
  ‚Ä¢ Selected Histogram GBDT with ROC AUC of 0.815

‚úì Strong Performance Metrics
  ‚Ä¢ ROC AUC: 0.815 (good discrimination ability)
  ‚Ä¢ Accuracy: 85% (correct predictions on test set)
  ‚Ä¢ Proper train/val/test split with stratification maintained class balance

‚úì End-to-End Pipeline
  ‚Ä¢ Automated data download with fallback URLs
  ‚Ä¢ Clean preprocessing pipeline (missing value imputation, stratified splits)
  ‚Ä¢ Deployable web interface (FastAPI backend + HTML frontend)
  ‚Ä¢ Batch prediction capability via CLI

‚úì Project Structure
  ‚Ä¢ Well-organized codebase (data, models, reports, src, web)
  ‚Ä¢ Reproducible with random seeds and metadata tracking


CHALLENGES FACED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚ö† Class Imbalance Impact
  ‚Ä¢ Dataset likely imbalanced (low diabetes prevalence in population)
  ‚Ä¢ Reflected in F1 Score (0.26) despite high accuracy (0.85)
  ‚Ä¢ High accuracy driven by correctly predicting majority class (no diabetes)
  ‚Ä¢ Low Average Precision (0.45) indicates difficulty detecting positive cases
  
‚ö† Precision-Recall Trade-off
  ‚Ä¢ Model prioritizes overall accuracy over precision for diabetes detection
  ‚Ä¢ May miss some true diabetes cases (lower recall) but minimizes false alarms
  ‚Ä¢ Appropriate for screening tool, but clinical deployment needs threshold tuning

‚ö† Limited Feature Engineering
  ‚Ä¢ Used raw features without interactions (e.g., BMI √ó Age, HighBP √ó HighChol)
  ‚Ä¢ Could potentially improve performance with domain-specific feature engineering
  ‚Ä¢ Trade-off: Simplicity vs. complexity in web interface

‚ö† Model Interpretation
  ‚Ä¢ Histogram GBDT chosen for performance, but less interpretable than Logistic Regression
  ‚Ä¢ Feature importance available, but exact decision logic is complex
  ‚Ä¢ Balancing interpretability vs. predictive power


UNEXPECTED INSIGHTS FROM RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üîç Histogram GBDT Outperformed Linear Model
  ‚Ä¢ Non-linear relationships in health data more important than expected
  ‚Ä¢ Gradient boosting captured complex interactions between features
  ‚Ä¢ Suggests diabetes risk is not simply additive (e.g., BMI alone)

üîç Physical Activity Feature
  ‚Ä¢ PhysActivity included in simplified feature set
  ‚Ä¢ May have lower individual importance but contributes as part of ensemble
  ‚Ä¢ Lifestyle factors interact with clinical indicators

üîç Calibration Behavior
  ‚Ä¢ Model shows calibration curve (probability calibration)
  ‚Ä¢ Important for risk prediction where probabilities have medical meaning
  ‚Ä¢ Helps in threshold selection for clinical decision-making

üîç Simplicity vs. Performance Trade-off Validated
  ‚Ä¢ 6 features achieved strong ROC AUC (0.815) without complex features
  ‚Ä¢ Proves that well-selected, clinically relevant features can be sufficient
  ‚Ä¢ User-friendly approach doesn't sacrifice significant model quality

üîç Dataset Quality Impact
  ‚Ä¢ BRFSS 2015 dataset (250k+ records) provided robust training
  ‚Ä¢ Large sample size helped model learn patterns reliably
  ‚Ä¢ Stratified splits maintained distribution across train/val/test

KEY TAKEAWAY FOR PRESENTATION
================================================================================
Successfully built a practical diabetes risk prediction tool that balances:
  ‚Ä¢ Model Performance: Strong ROC AUC (0.815) for clinical screening
  ‚Ä¢ User Experience: Simple 6-feature input suitable for web deployment
  ‚Ä¢ Technical Soundness: Proper ML pipeline, model comparison, evaluation

Main limitation: Class imbalance affects precision for positive class detection,
which is typical for medical screening applications and can be addressed with
threshold tuning based on clinical priorities.
